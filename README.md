FanGraphs is a popular website among the baseball community.
The website is most well-known for its vast coverage of statistics.
The `FanGraphs` package contains various modules for scraping and exporting data from various webpages.
There are not, by any means, intentions to cover the entire website.
The sheer amount of data makes it too difficult of a task.
However, there are plans to cover the most popular webpages.
